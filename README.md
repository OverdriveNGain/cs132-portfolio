## Project Summary üìù

As of 2021, [Filipinos remain the most active internet, social media users globally](https://technology.inquirer.net/107561/filipinos-remain-most-active-internet-so). But, this makes us even more vulnerable to disinformation campaigns in social media that are meant to fuel a political agenda, such as [turning the tides of our Presidential elections](https://up.edu.ph/filipino-voters-were-engulfed-in-relentless-stream-of-disinformation/) and [censoring our freedom of speech](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-12-07/how-rodrigo-duterte-turned-facebook-into-a-weapon-with-a-little-help-from-facebook). 

For our Introduction to Data Science class, we explore the influence of disinformation spread on Twitter to influence the **shutdown of the largest news network in the Philippibes**. This is our portfolio for our results.
